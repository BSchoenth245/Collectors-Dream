## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Linux Desktop Integration
- **App Icon**: Custom icons display in the application window but may show default Electron icon in file managers/taskbars
- **Cause**: AppImage format limitations with certain Linux desktop environments
- **Impact**: Visual only - does not affect functionality

### Performance Considerations

- **Recommendation**: Use category filters to improve search speed on large datasets

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application Won't Start**:
1. Verify MongoDB is installed and running
2. Check if port 8000 is available
3. Ensure you have write permissions in the application directory

**Database Connection Failed**:
1. Restart MongoDB service: `sudo systemctl restart mongod` (Linux)
2. Check database directory permissions: `./data/db`
3. Review MongoDB logs for specific error messages

**Port Already in Use**:
1. Change the port in `server.js` (line ~10): `const PORT = 8001;`
2. Or stop the process using port 8000: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9`

**Permission Denied (Linux)**:
1. Ensure the application can create the `data` directory
2. Run with appropriate permissions: `chmod +x Collectors-Dream-1.0.1.AppImage`
3. For development: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./data`
